Success! Created first-react-app at /home/dci/apps/fbw48/May/25-05-21/first-react-app
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

npm start
Starts the development server.

npm run build
Bundles the app into static files for production.

npm test
Starts the test runner.

npm run eject
Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

cd first-react-app
npm start

Happy hacking!

Now a page with react inside is opened
