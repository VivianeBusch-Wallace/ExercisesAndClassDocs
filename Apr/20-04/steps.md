dev dependencies
everything you don't need in real life
stuff you only need as a dev

dependencies
are the things you also need outside of your development phase
needed for deployed version

Stepm 1:
install bootsrap package (just like the other packages)
terminal: npm install bootstrap

go to main scss and import bootstrap:
bootstrap is inside node modules
@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap.scss"
now all of bootstrap is inside your css file
