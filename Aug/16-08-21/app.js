// morgan is a Node.js and Express middleware to log HTTP requests and errors, and simplifies the process.
// In Node.js and Express, middleware is a function that has access to the request and response lifecycle methods,
// and the next() method to continue logic in your Express server. source: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/nodejs-getting-started-morgan

/* Logging is an important element of writing software as it helps us to see the software operations, debug and catch errors.
morgan is a logging tool (middleware) that can be used in HTTP servers implemented using Express & Node.js.
It can be used to log requests, errors, and more to the console. */

// Notes:
/* we will create our own apis
we don't hide our PORT for security reasons, it just is in the config file and we want to hide other things there
If we want to create a secure connection with https then do we write:
const server = https.createServer(app);  ? and what if we want both to work? or maybe if someone types http... we automatically turn it into https, how does that work?
>> No http is for our build, if you want to add security level on your app you can use the domain (the one that host your app) to secure your app
Never forget to export app or the other routers
