Time Management App for chores
idea:
pomodoro-like app
"Do as much as you can in a short given time"
for ex: "Clean up as much as you can in your bedroom for 10 mins."

For the user:
1.  user opens app
    (optional) user sets up account
2.  used gets explained what pomodoro method is and how this app works
3.  user sets chore from a list or creates an option yourself
4.  user sets time for that chore and duration
5.  when it's time to clean, reminder message, if not a good time, reschedule
6.  after user did it user sees congrats message
----------
(optional)
7.  user rates how well he did in his opinion.
8.  then a point system is assigned, ex: a job well done 10 points, bad job 1 point
    (not zero because at least he tried)
9.  the more points user gathers the higher the score
10. (optional) for a certain score user gets a reward (or can build something)

app:
arrays with chores
(option to add an individual chore) = just add to array
values include the rooms

set time options
reminder when it's time for chore (instead of console.log maybe alert()?)

set duration for chore (ex: 10 mins, 15 mins, 5 mins)
